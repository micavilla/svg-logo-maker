# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This command-line application takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The user is prompted to provide text, select a shape and the logo's colors; once completed with answering the prompts, their answers are saved and the application generates the desired logo to an SVG file. If the user inputs more than three characters for their logo, the application will ask them to enter their logo's text again and then proceed to the next question once the condition is met. The user will then input a color or hexadecimal number for their text's color as well as their shape's color. For the last question, the user chooses a shape out of the three choices provided: circle, triangle, or square. Once answered, the command-line terminal confirms, "Generated logo.svg," and an SVG file is created in the 'examples' folder which can be opened in a browser to display a 300x200 pixel image of the user's created logo.
